##Air Quality Prediction
- Predicted Pollution Levels by building linear regression model, designed a machine learning model which can predict the air quality index. Tech Stack :- Python, ML (Linear Regression).

##Chemical Segregation
- Build a  binary classifier using Logistic Regression which can categorise chemicals, based on some features.

##Handwritten Digit Recognition 
- Applied K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm in recognizing handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the MNIST dataset. 
- Developed a system from scratch which includes a machine to understand and classify the images of handwritten digits as 10 digits (0–9). Accuracy of the model was around 98%. Tech Stack - Python, ML(KNN), OpenCV, MNIST Database.

##Dominant Color Extraction 
- Applied K Means Clustering Unsupervised Algorithm in Segmenting an image into set ok K Dominant Colors. 
- Extracted the K Dominant Colors from the image and then re-colorized it using those K Colors. Tech Stack - Python, ML(K-Means), OpenCV
